<p>
The unbelievable flourishing of engineering as a stream of study is, undoubtedly, another
blessing of science. It is only after the extensive development of science and technology, service sectors have grown and the confinement has gone giving way to a wide scale scope to the young people to work and earn their fortune. Even though we have had great engineers like Chandra Gupta Vikramaditya some thousand years back, the number was really less. But today the scenario has changed completely as we see innumerable aspirants trying their luck in this profession.
</p>

<h2>Endless career options in engineering -Various streams:</h2>
<img src="../images/imagesas.jpg" style=" height:180; width:400;">
<p>
As has been mentioned earlier there are a number of options in engineering and you have to choose among them. To make your task easy, we have tried to give you some idea regarding a few but the most important streams.
</p>
  
<h2>Computer science and IT : </h2>
<p>In technical era people are very much keen to do something with computers and computers are also starts to show off there versatility in every sector but if you want run a application through computer then you have to make a program and then it’s necessary to run this program  to get the result from that application. Career in computer science engineering and IT streams involves two type of work profiles: Software and Hardware. Software deals with writing instructions in terms of source code which is used to tell computer system how to perform a certain task. Whereas Hardware deals with computer components, computer security systems and computer networks which are used to transfer data. Computer science is a kind of studies where programmers normally born with there unique concept. According to a source this is the most demandable subjects in engineering. There is high scope of hardware and networking also with the increasing trend of automation in various organizations.</p>

<h2>Mechanical Engineering: </h2>
<p>A mechanical age is running out every where in the world now, even efforts are put to make clones or robot which will be a substitute of human.This deals with study of machines and heavy machinery.It involves design,manufacturing and maintenance of machines and mechanical systems. This field uses mechanical science concepts such as thermodynamics, kinematics, material science along with softwares such as CAD(computer aided design) to design analyze and do maintenance of industrial plants, machinery, transport systems, medical devices and robotics. CAD is software  for mechanical engineering which help in designing mechanical system and test its performance in computer system.This is evergreen field and mechanical engineers are always in demand in almost every sector dealing with machinery. Automobile, Industrial sectors have great career options for mechanical engineering .</p>

<h2>Electronics engineering: </h2>
<p>Suddenly world has change its dimension of demand now every one wants deal with something which can be run automatically from satellite to car for kids each and every sectors you can see the demands of electronics goods increasing day by day, and electronics engineering is a kind of studies which helps students to became a genius in this sector. One familiar example of Electronics is chipset in computer’s motherboard. Students in this stream have to study lot of electronic circuits.There are great opportunities for electronics engineers in IT, telecom, Broadcasting, Aviation, Defense and research organisations.</p>
