					<b style="color:#f4440e; font-size:28px;"> Home Equity Loan </b><br /> <br />
A home equity loan is a type of loan in which the borrower uses the equity of his or her home as collateral. The loan amount is determined by the value of the property, and the value of the property is determined by an appraiser from the lending institution. Home equity loans are often used to finance major expenses such as home repairs, medical bills, or college education. A home equity loan creates a lien against the borrower's house and reduces actual home equity. <br /><br />
Most home equity loans require good to excellent credit history, reasonable loan-to-value and combined loan-to-value ratios. Home equity loans come in two types: closed end (traditionally just called a home-equity loan) and open end (aka a home-equity line of credit). Both are usually referred to as second mortgages, because they are secured against the value of the property, just like a traditional mortgage. Home equity loans and lines of credit are usually, but not always, for a shorter term than first mortgages. Home equity loan can be used as a person's main mortgage in place of a traditional mortgage. However, one cannot purchase a home using a home equity loan, one can only use a home equity loan to refinance. In the United States, in most cases it is possible to deduct home equity loan interest on one's personal income taxes.

					<b style="color:#f4440e; font-size:28px;"> Car Loan </b><br /> <br />
A car loan is a personal loan that allows the potential buyer to pay the vehicle off in monthly payments instead of having to pay the full price all at once. This means that a lending servicer or bank will pay off the car in full, while in return the borrower pays off the debt in monthly payments with an interest fee included as well.<br /><br />
This type of personal loan may be either a secured or non-secured loan depending on the situation they are in. But for the most part lenders will usually offer a loan that is secured just in case the borrower falls behind on their payments and fails to pay off the debt. If the borrower fails to pay the monthly payments, their lender will repossess the car to pay off the debt. To qualify for an unsecured loan the borrower must have a very high credit score and also issue a higher interest rate on the loan as well. <br /><br />
Most of the time lenders will be very quick to offer a secured loan even with bad credit, because of the fact that the vehicle is used as collateral if the borrower fails to pay. People with a very low credit rating may be able to take advantage of this loan by paying all the monthly payments on time. By doing this they will be able to begin restoring their credit score.
